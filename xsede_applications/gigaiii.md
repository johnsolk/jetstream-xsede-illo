# Jetstream proposal

Jetstream access for the Bioinformatics Training Workshop at the GIGA III Conference

**Abstract**
 
Over 95% of metazoan diversity is comprised of invertebrates, however comparatively few invertebrate genomes have been sequenced and assembled. The overarching goal of the Global Invertebrate Genomics Alliance (GIGA) is to establish a dynamic network of scientists from across the world to develop community resources to study diverse invertebrate genomes. To support graduate and postdoctoral students training in this field and intending to apply state of the art bioinformatics, GIGA has now organized its 3rd GlGA Conference and Workshop to be held at the Curaçao Hilton from the 19-22nd October 2018 – https://gigaiii.weebly.com/. The goal of this conference is to bring together GIGA researchers to promote and train in the field of invertebrate transcriptomics and genomics. GIGA III has support from NSF and the American Genetics Association (AGA) for approximately 32 student and postdoctoral fellowships to attend the conference, including the bioinformatics training workshop which is dedicated to hands-on practical training in computational biology tools. 

This proposal is requesting access to Jetstream resources to provide computational capacity for the 100 participants in this bioinformatics training workshop. Access to the Jetstream platform will allow all participants to have uniform computational environments with a workshop-specific software installation image, which will reduce the technical difficulties associated with computing in a remote location. Instruction will begin with a basic BASH command-line tutorial followed by genome assembly, then will continue with more advanced assembly and annotation analysis tools such as MAKER, AUGUSTUS and BUSCO. Jetstream-specific bioinformatics tutorials and software installation image will be adapted from those that were developed and tested for the Data Intensive Biology Summer Institute held at UC Davis in 2017 and 2018 by Titus Brown.
 
An expert team of instructors has been assembled to conduct and develop tutorial materials and sample datasets for the workshop that will be specific for invertebrate genomics and transcriptomics analysis:

**Resource Justification**

We are requesting 100 m. medium instances with 6 cores, 16 GB RAM, and 130 GB VM space each for each instructor and student for 1 week. The total request is for 100,800 service units (6 cores * 24 hrs/day * 7 days * 100 people). Persistent storage beyond the duration is not necessary for this training workshop.
These calculations are based on a similar but much longer running workshop run by C. Titus Brown with the same number of attendees.
